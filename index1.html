         <p>The day a student goes to school for the first time is called first day at school. My first day at school is a memorable day for me. It is a red-letter day for me. When my parents declared the news of my schooling, I became very much excited and started leaping and dancing in great joy. Then the expected day came. I went to every member of our family and received blessings from all. I was in a very happy and cheerful mood. I went to school for the first time when I was only seven years old. My father took me to school for the first time. I was little nervous at the beginning. I remember it well. I was then a little boy. I was very interested in going to school with riding rickshaw accompanied by my father. First I met with Headmaster at school. My heart beat fast. But this smiling face and gentle words put me at ease.
