<p class="design1">All the ingredients that we have around us are jointly known as environment. Environment pollution implies the contamination of the surroundings. Any abnormal change of environment in chemical, physical and biological characteristics in environment is called environment pollution. Environment is the whole system of our existence. Our environment is becoming polluted everyday for several reasons. Human beings mainly pollute environment. Massive industrialization is an important cause of environment. Smoke from motor vehicles also pollutes environment. Serious environment pollution occurs in big cities because buses, trucks and cars play in the streets everyday and emit smoke. Mills and factories also pollute water. They throw their waste products into rivers and canals. By burning wood and melting pitch for road construction people make more smoke and pollute air. We use pesticide in our crop fields. It also pollutes our environment. Indiscriminate cutting of trees has also turned unbalanced environment. The ecological balance is being lost as a result of environment pollution. If we all desire to live a healthy and tranquillized life, we should make our environment clean and free from pollution. We should be all whole-heartedly in keeping our environment fit for habitation.

<p class="design2"> Every student has to study in different institutions in different spheres of life. Accordingly I left my school for higher studies. Before leaving school, I want to recall some events concerning my school. My last day at school is a memorable day to me. The students of our school bade us farewell on this day. The hall room was nicely decorated. Separate arrangement was made for us to sit. Our respected teachers took their seat on this dais. One of our teachers called out our names. We went up the dais one by one and the students gave us flowers and the headmaster gave the copy of “YOU WILL WIN” By Shib Kahake. With the gift we took our seats. Students delivered their short speech and begged forgiveness for our misdeed if any. Our teachers gave us valuable advice. The function being over, we were entertained with refreshment. Then left the school compound. Standing on the road I looked back home with a heavy heart.</p>
